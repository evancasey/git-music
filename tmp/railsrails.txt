Closes #15942 Note that `_will_change!` is,,,,,,,,,,,,no longer needed for AR instances

Leave,,,,,,,,,,,,the note for `ActiveModel`, since it,,,,,,,,,,,,can't yet detect mutations
(hopefully we can,,,,,,,,,,,,change this in time for 4.2).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,However, we now detect
mutations on all supported types in `ActiveRecord`, so we can note that
`_will_change!` is no longer needed there. We are talking about the libraries, not the constants MySQL doesn't works with foreign key rename sequence only if it exists Improve tests to use add_foreign_key DSL Improvements per code review.

* General style fixes.
* Add changes to configuration guide.
* Add missing tests. Update documentation for run_callbacks

In some cases run_callbacks will return nil.  I'm attempting to update the documentation for the method to clarify. Do not change the global state of the test suite Merge pull request,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,#15946 from jamesprior/patch-1

Update documentation for run_callbacks Always instrument ActiveSupport::Cache

The current approach is,,,,,,broken because it uses a thread local value
which means on multi-threaded environments,,,,,,it has to be turned on
per thread. Secondly, ActiveSupport::Notifications does not
instrument items,,,,,,when there are not subscribers so this flag is
unnecessary. Merge pull request,,,,,,#15933 from rafael/master

Add always permitted parameters as a configurable option.
